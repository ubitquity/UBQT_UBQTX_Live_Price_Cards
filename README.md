# UBQT_UBQTX_Live_Price_Cards
A self-contained JavaScript module for creating live, auto-updating price cards for UBQTX and UBQT tokens. Easily integrate real-time crypto data into any website.

How to Integrate

Integrating the price cards is a simple two-step process:

Add the HTML container: Place this div element wherever you want the price cards to appear on your website.

HTML

<div id="nftp-price-widgets"></div>
Add the JavaScript: Place this <script> tag just before the closing </body> tag of your website.

HTML

<script src="https://path/to/your/nftp-price-widgets.js"></script> 
(You will first need to save the JavaScript code provided below into a file named nftp-price-widgets.js and upload it to your web server.)

That's it! The script will automatically find the div and build the price cards inside it.

## Source Code (nftp-price-widgets.js)
Save the source code into a file named nftp-price-widgets.js.
